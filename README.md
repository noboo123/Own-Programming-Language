# your own programming language
Made by David Callanan: https://github.com/davidcallanan


original README.md:
py-myopl-code
All code for my "Make your own programming language in Python" tutorial series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD

This code is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language written in Python 3.

The latest code is in the folder which is for the latest episode (ep14).

I'm now finished with the development of this project, and the tutorials are complete on YouTube.
